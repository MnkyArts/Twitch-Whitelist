	Minecraft: Twitch Whitelister
</h1>
Minecraft: Twitch Whitelister is a handy tool designed for streamer or groups of streamers to streamline the process of managing viewer access to their Minecraft servers. By linking their Twitch accounts, the tool can authenticate viewers and grant whitelist access based on their Twitch follow or subscription status. üéÆüîí

## Features

- **Sleek Design**: Simple but sleek design using tailwindcss. üòé
- **Stream Follower Verification**: Easily check if a user follows your stream or any of your group of streamers. ‚úîÔ∏è
- **Stream Subscription Verification**: Easily check if a user is subscribed to your stream or any of your group of streamers. ‚úîÔ∏è
- **Effortless Whitelisting**: Viewers can seamlessly whitelist themselves by logging in through Twitch and entering their Minecraft username. üìù
- **Database Integration**: Prevent viewers from whitelisting multiple Minecraft accounts with a single Twitch account by utilizing a robust database system. üóÉÔ∏è
- **Simple Setup**: Utilize the convenience of a .env file for easy configuration and setup. ‚öôÔ∏è

## How It Works

1. **Twitch Authentication**: Viewers log in through Twitch to authenticate their identity.
2. **Follow Status Check**: The tool verifies if the viewer follows the broadcaster's stream or any of the designated group of streamers.
3. **Whitelisting**: Verified viewers can whitelist themselves by entering their Minecraft username.
4. **Database Management**: The system ensures that each Twitch account can whitelist only one Minecraft username, maintaining fairness and integrity.
5. **Access Granted**: Authenticated and whitelisted viewers gain access to the Minecraft server, fostering a community-driven gaming experience.
